The icon was a random image from my PC, I have no idea what it is from.

# config.json
Sample file below:
{
  "windows": [
    {
      "title": "EVE -.*",
      "x": 100,
      "y": 100,
      "width": 192,
      "height": 108,
      "hotkeys": []
    }
  ]
}


# building
Use: dotnet publish

Note:
You may modify RuntimeIdentifier to Win-x86 to build a 32 bit application.

# Why do you have no builds
It is bad practice.

Download dotnet 8.0 sdk, then using a console, navigate to the directory the source code is in and run the dotnet publish command.

Once that completes successfully, navigate to the publish folder (./bin/Release/win-x64/publish/), the exe can be copied from this folder and used.

Make sure to include a config.json file in the same folder as the exe!
